/**
  * A developer can disable some core api.
  *
  * 1) Akka library doesn't provide a way, given a Route, to access to its Directives and modify them.
  * 2) Akka library evaluates the route to be executed by selecting those match the uri path and method. The first one matched is executed.
  * 3) SidechainApiRoute, the trait implemented by all core apis, has a variable of type Route initialized at compile time.
  *
  * Given 1), 2) and 3), and in order to avoid to apply changes to all core apis, it's possible to disable some uri path
  * by adding a route with a reject directive for that uri path.
  *
  * When the application starts, all routes are concatenated in a single composed route.
  * These rejection routes should be concatenated as first.
