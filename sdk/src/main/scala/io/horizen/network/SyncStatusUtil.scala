  The calculateEstimatedHighestBlock will calculate the estimated highest block given a set of input data and reading
  other data from the node view . The method will calculate the block correction performing a weighted average between
  block corrections from genesis and from sidechain half.
  The block correction from genesis block is calculated taking the timestamp between the genesis block and the current
  block and then calculate how many blocks would be present if they had been generated in a period equal to the block
  time (12 seconds). Calculate in the same way the block correction starting from sidechain half.
  Then we calculate the global block correction performing a weighted average between the block corrections from genesis
  with a weight equal to 0.5 and the block correction from sidechain half with a weight of 1.0.
  With the global block correction, the current timestamp and the current block height is finally possible to calculate
  the estimated highest block
