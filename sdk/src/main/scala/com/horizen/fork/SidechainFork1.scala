/*
1- In the mainchain we have a limitation on the amount of BTs that we can have inside a certificate.
   This limitation is not handled inside the Sidechain SDK and this may lead in the creation of an invalid certificate.
   For this reason in the SidechainFork1 we add some restrictions on the amount of BT that can mined inside a withdrawal epoch.
   The maximum amount of BT allowed in a certificate is 3999, the idea is that for every MC block reference that we sync we open up
   the possibility to mine some WithdrawalBoxes until we reach the limit of 3999 in the last block of the withdrawal epoch.

2- We have the possibility to restrict the forging operation to a predefined set of forgers "closed forging state" and there is no way to
   change from this state to an "open forging state" where everyone are allowed to forge.
   Inside this SidechainFork1 we give this opportunity by adding a new kind of transaction "OpenStakeTransaction"
   that let the current allowed forgers to vote for the forge opening.
   If the majority of the allowed forgers send this transactions, the forging operation is then opened to everyone.
