"""
Check multiple certificates processing:
1. Inclusion of multiple certificates for given SC in the same MC block
2. Top quality certificate verification.
3. Different SC chain top quality certificate processing - chain growing prevention.

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 2 SC nodes (with default websocket configuration).
    Both SC nodes are forgers and certificate submitters.
    SC node 1 has all schnorr private keys for cert submission
    SC node 2 has less schnorr private keys than SC node 1 for cert submission.
    SC nodes are connected.

Test:
    - create and enable forger stakes for the SC node 2.
    - generate MC blocks to reach one block before the end of the withdrawal epoch (WE)
    - generate SC blocks to sync with MC node.
    - disconnect SC nodes.
    - SC node 2 generates 1 SC block with one BackwardTransfer request.
    - generate 2 MC blocks to switch WE.
    - SC node 2 generates 2 SC blocks with one MC block ref included in each.
    - SC node 2 automatically starts generating Certificate -> than do submit.
    - SC node 1 generates 2 SC blocks with one MC block ref included in each.
    - SC node 1 automatically starts generating Certificate with better quality -> than do submit.
    - MC node generate 1 block and checks certificates inclusion.
    - Both SC nodes generate 1 SC block each and checks certificates inclusion.
    - generate MC blocks to reach end submission window. 
    - SC nodes generates blocks to sync with MC:
        * SC node 1 can sync with MC, because follows the top quality cert data.
        * SC node 2 can't grow SC chain, because it follows wrong cert data.
    - Connect SC nodes again and check that SC node 2 synced to the state of SC Node 1
