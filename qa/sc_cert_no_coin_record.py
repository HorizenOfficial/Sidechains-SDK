"""
Check CertificateSubmitter reaction if top quality certificate in MC has no Coins DB record:
Note:
    Before the certificate (and cert proof) creation Submitter validates the quality against the MC known cert quality.
    Check that MC can return a valid inchain cert data even if all the outputs of the cert were spend.
    So, no coin available and no way to get the block access so the cert access.
    We need to be sure that MC can deal with such case (zend_oo PR 214) and SC is compatible with it.

Configuration:
    Start 2 MC nodes and 2 SC nodes (with default websocket configuration).
    SC node 1 is a forger.
    SC node 2 is a certificate submitter.
    SC nodes are connected.
    MC nodes are connected.

Test:
    - Send some coins to MC node 2
    - Reach the end of the withdrawal epoch and generate cert by SC node 2.
    - Spend all UTXOs of MC node 2
    - Reach the next submission window and be sure that SC node was able to produce a certificate (no websocket errors on MC side).
