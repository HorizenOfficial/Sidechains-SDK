Sidechain has ceased in 3 epochs (certificates appeared in epochs 1 and 2) - active certificate in epoch 1 presents.
Sidechain lifetime is full withdrawal epochs 0,1,2 + submission window of epoch 3 

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 1 SC node (with default websocket configuration).
    SC node connected to the first MC node.
    SC node has ENABLED certificate submitter.

Test:
    For the SC node:
        - ############## EPOCH 0 #####################
        - Send 1 FT to SC node 1 on different addresses.
        - Generate 1 MC and 1 SC block to see FT in the sidechain. Check FT and save its box ids.
        - Spend 1 FT sending coins to the SC node 1. Remember the resulting box id.
        - Send another transaction from SC node 1 to itself.
        - Generate MC and SC blocks to reach the end of the Withdrawal epoch 0.
        - Verify that we have the FeePaymentBox inside the last block of the epoch and save its box id.
        
        - ############## EPOCH 1 #####################
        - Wait for certificate submission.
        - Generate 1 MC and 1 SC block including the certificate.
        - Generate MC and SC blocks to reach the end of the Withdrawal epoch 1.
        
        - ############## EPOCH 2 #####################
        - Wait for certificate submission.
        - Generate 1 MC and 1 SC block including the certificate.
        - Generate MC and SC blocks to reach the end of the Withdrawal epoch 2.
        - Disable certificate submitter.

        - ############## EPOCH 3 #####################
        - Generate MC and SC blocks to reach the end of the submission window of epoch 3.  
        - Check that sc has ceased.
        - Create the CSW proof for the FeePaymentBox of the epoch0 and send CSW to MC. Check the results.
