Check all reasons why a transaction cannot be added to the mem pool.

Configuration:
    - 1 SC node
    - 1 MC node

Test:
   - Verify that following transactions are not added to the mempool
    - negative nonce
    - negative value
    - max fee lower than priority fee
    - gas limit > 64 bits
    - gas limit > block gas limit
    - smart contract creation with empty data
    - gas limit < intrinsic gas
    - nonce too low
    - size too big
    - nonce gap too big
    - account size exceeded
