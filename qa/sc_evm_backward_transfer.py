"""
Checks Certificate automatic creation and submission to MC for an EVM Sidechain:
1. Creation of Certificate with no backward transfers.
2. Creation of Certificate with multiple backward transfers.

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 1 SC node (with default websocket configuration).
    SC node connected to the first MC node.

Note:
    This test can be executed in two modes:
    1. using no key rotation circuit (by default)
    2. using key rotation circuit (with --certcircuittype=NaiveThresholdSignatureCircuitWithKeyRotation)
    With key rotation circuit can be executed in two modes:
    1. ceasing (by default)
    2. non-ceasing (with --nonceasing flag)

Test:
    For the SC node:
        - Checks that MC block with sc creation tx is referenced in the genesis sc block
        - verifies that there are no withdrawal requests yet
        - creates new forward transfer to sidechain
        - verifies that the receiving account balance is changed
        - generate MC and SC blocks to reach the end of the Withdrawal epoch 0
        - generate one more MC and SC block accordingly and await for certificate submission to MC node mempool
        - check epoch 0 certificate with not backward transfers in the MC mempool
        - mine 1 more MC block and forge 1 more SC block, check Certificate inclusion into SC block
        - make 2 different withdrawals from SC
        - reach next withdrawal epoch and verify that certificate for epoch 1 was added to MC mempool
          and then to MC/SC blocks.
        - verify epoch 1 certificate, verify backward transfers list    
        - interoperability tests
