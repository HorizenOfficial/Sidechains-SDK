"""
Check Certificate automatic creation and submission to MC:
1. Creation of Certificate with no backward transfers.
2. Creation of Certificate with multiple backward transfers.

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 1 SC node (with default websocket configuration).
    SC node connected to the first MC node.

Note:
    This test can be executed in two modes:
    1. using no key rotation circuit (by default)
    2. using key rotation circuit (with --certcircuittype=NaiveThresholdSignatureCircuitWithKeyRotation)
    With key rotation circuit can be executed in two modes:
    1. ceasing (by default)
    2. non-ceasing (with --nonceasing flag)
    
Test:
    For the SC node:
        - verify that all keys/boxes/balances are coherent with the default initialization
        - verify the MC block is included
        - create new forward transfer to sidechain
        - create backward transfer with 53(must fail) and 54 Satoshi with
           - withdrawCoins
           - createCoreTransactionSimplified
           - createCoreTransaction
        - reach next withdrawal epoch and verify that certificate for epoch 0 was added to MC mempool
          and then to MC/SC blocks.
        - verify epoch 0 certificate, verify backward transfers list
