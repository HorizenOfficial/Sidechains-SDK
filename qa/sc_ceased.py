Check ceased sidechain reaction:
1. No Certificates for given sidechain for given epoch -> ceasing detection -> chain growing prevention

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 1 SC node (with default websocket configuration).
    SC node is forger, but not a certificate submitter.

Test:
    - generate MC blocks to reach one block before the end of the certificate submission window.
    - generate SC blocks to sync with MC node.
    - generate 1 MC block to reach the end of the certificate submission window.
    - check with MC node that sidechain is ceased from MC perspective.
    - generate SC block with 1 MC ref: check that SC has ceased from SC perspective.
    - try to generate one more SC block:
        * check that it's not valid
        * SC node can't grow SC chain, because sidechain has ceased.
