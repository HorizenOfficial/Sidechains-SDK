"""
Check mem pool behaviour when it reached its maximum size.

Configuration:
    - 2 SC nodes
    - 1 MC node
Tests:
    - Create 3 MC blocks and 3 corresponding SC blocks, containing some transactions
    - Add as many transactions as needed to reach the maximum mempool size. Add an additional tx and verify that the 
    oldest tx in the mempool is evicted. This eviction in turn will transform some txs from executable to non executable 
    so the non exec sub pool size will be exceeded too. A second tx will then be evicted.
    - Revert the 3 MC blocks. This will revert the SC blocks and the contained transactions will be reinserted in the 
    mempool. The sum of the txs already in the mempool and of the reinserted txs will exceeds the maximum size of the 
    mempool and the oldest txs will be evicted, including some of the reinserted txs. Check that the reinserted txs are 
    evicted starting from the biggest nonce.

Note: The second SC node is used to check that locally and remotely generated transactions/blocks are treated in the 
same way.
