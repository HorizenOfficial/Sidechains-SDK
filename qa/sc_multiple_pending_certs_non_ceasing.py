Check multiple certificates processing for non-ceasing sidechain:
1. Check that signer/submitter node may keep working in case of pending certificate queue:
    * sidechain and mainchain go further to the next epochs, but for the current one there is not enough sigs to submit cert.
2. Check that signer node may contribute to the pending certificate queue after sync with the network.

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 2 SC nodes (with default websocket configuration).
    SC Node 1 is the only forger.
    SC node 1 has 3 schnorr private keys [0, 1, 2] for cert submission. Submitter and signer are ENABLED.
    SC node 1 has 3 other schnorr private keys [3, 4, 5] for cert submission. Submitter is DISABLED and signer is ENABLED.
    SC nodes are disconnected.
    Sidechain is non-ceasing sidechain.

Test:
    - Send FT to SC node 1 to have some coins for Withdrawal requests.
    - Generate MC blocks for 5 full withdrawal epochs and in parallel generate SC blocks to sync with all new MC blocks.
        For every epoch N create N withdrawal request boxes: epoch 0 - 0 BTs, epoch 4 - 4 BTs.
        It is needed to check properly the validation of Certificates on SC side.
    _ Check that from SC node 1 perspective sc is ALIVE. (non-ceasing sidechains are always alive). 
    - Wait a bit and check that SC node 1 has NOT started cert submission (not enough signatures for the first cert)
    - Connect SC node 2 and sync sc nodes.
    - Check that certificate submission is in progress on SC node 1
    - Wait for the cert in MC mempool and generate 1 MC block and 1 SC block with that Cert.
    - Check that we started generating certificate for the next epoch in the queue.
    - Repeat previous 2 steps to see that we generated all certificates except the one for epoch 5 (not a moment)
    - Generate more MC and SC blocks. Check the submission of the Cert for epoch 5.
