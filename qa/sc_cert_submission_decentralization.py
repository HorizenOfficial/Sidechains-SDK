Check Pretty Good Decentralization (PGD), the certificate submission decentralization:
1. Creation of Certificate in a network with no certificate signers majority on the single node.

Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 4 SC node (with default websocket configuration).
    All SC nodes are connected to the first MC node.
    First SC node is a submitter.
    First SC node obtains 2 keys: (0,1)
    Second SC node obtains 2 keys: (2,3)
    Third SC node obtains all keys: (0-6), but signing is disabled
    Fourth SC node obtains 3 keys: (4,5,6)
    
    Network schema:
        N1 <-> N2 <-> N3 <-> N4
Test:
    For the SC node:
        - generate MC and SC blocks to reach the end of the Withdrawal epoch 0
        - generate one more MC and SC block accordingly and await for certificate submission to MC node mempool
        - check for the epoch 0 certificate in the MC mempool
        - validate certificate quality, all keys expected to be involved (quality = 7 of 7)
        - disconnect the fourth SC node from the network.
        - reach the end of the Withdrawal epoch 1
        - check that Certificate Submission was not started because of lack of singers.
        - Connect back the third and fourth SC nodes
        - check for the epoch 1 certificate in the MC mempool
        - validate certificate quality, all keys expected to be involved (quality = 7 of 7)
