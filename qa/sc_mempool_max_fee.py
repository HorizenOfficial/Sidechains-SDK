Check forger txes sorting algorithm based on feerate.
Configuration:
    Start 1 MC node and 2 SC node (with default websocket configuration).
    SC node1 connected to the first MC node and has max_fee parameter.
    SC node2 connected to the first MC node and has no max_fee parameter.
Test:
    - Verify that SC node1 is not able to send a transaction with fee > max_fee
    - Verify that SC node1 is able to send a transaction with fee = max_fee
    - Verify that SC node1 is able to send a transaction with fee < max_fee
    
    - Verify that SC node2 is able to send a transaction with fee > node1 max_fee (node 2 doesn't have this limit)
    - Verify that SC node1 included the last transaction in its mempool even if it has fee > max_fee
