## Notes about new/updated Features

### Native Smart Contracts <> EVM Smart Contracts Interoperability
It is now possible for an EVM Smart Contract to invoke a Native Smart Contract function and vice-versa. 
The EVM Smart Contract can invoke a Native Smart Contract function using the following low-level functions:
- `staticcall`
- `call`

`delegatecall` and `callcode` cannot be used instead, they will return an error in case they are used with Native
Smart Contracts.

In addition, it is possible to use the Solidity interface describing the Native Smart Contract.
Files with the Native Smart Contract Solidity interfaces can be found under:
`qa/SidechainTestFramework/account/smart_contract_resources/contracts/`.

Example of Native Smart Contract invocation in Solidity using low-level `staticcall` function:

```
 // ...
address contractAddr = address(0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222222);
(bool success, bytes memory result) = contractAddr.staticcall{gas: 100000}(
    abi.encodeWithSignature("getAllForgersStakes()")
);

 // ...
```

Example using Solidity interface:

```
import "./ForgerStakes.sol";

    // ...
    ForgerStakes nativeContract = ForgerStakes(0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222222);
    nativeContract.getAllForgersStakes{gas: 100000}();

    // ...
    
```
